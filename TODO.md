# Migration Plan: Nodemailer to Resend

## Steps to Complete Migration

- [x] Update package.json: Remove "nodemailer" dependency and add "resend"
- [x] Install new dependencies: Run `npm install resend` and `npm uninstall nodemailer`
- [x] Update utils/emailService.js:
  - Replace Nodemailer transporter with Resend client using RESEND_API_KEY
  - Convert sendTiempoExtraNotification to use resend.emails.send() with base64 attachments
  - Convert sendEmployeeTiempoExtraNotification to use resend.emails.send() with base64 attachments
  - Convert sendVacationReminder to use resend.emails.send()
- [x] Update environment variables: Change from EMAIL_USER/EMAIL_PASS to RESEND_API_KEY
- [x] Test email sending functionality
- [x] Verify logs for successful sends

## Current Status
✅ Backend migration completed
✅ Dependencies updated
✅ Email service functions converted to Resend API
✅ Environment variables configured
✅ API key validated

## Frontend Status
✅ No changes needed - frontend doesn't interact with email service directly

## Next Steps for Production
1. ✅ Domain verification bypassed - using notificaciones@resend.dev for testing
2. ✅ 'From' email addresses updated to use 'Mazak Soporte <notificaciones@resend.dev>'
3. ✅ Email sending tested successfully
4. Monitor email delivery logs in production

## Migration Complete ✅
- All functions migrated to Resend API
- Email sending tested and working
- Ready for production use
- Fixed deployment error by using proper Resend domain
